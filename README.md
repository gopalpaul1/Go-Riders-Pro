### Project Details

The page was first designed and responsive for the GoRidersPro project. Having created fakedata for some information of the project, I have created a card with the image and name of the riders for that information on the first page. A login form has been created to go to the second page. If someone is logged in they can login and if they are not logged in they have to signup, then they will be allowed to go to another page. Private route has been used for this. I have taken the form and map for the second location. Details of the next page location are shown. Thank You
